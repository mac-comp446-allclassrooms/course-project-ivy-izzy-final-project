# ✨So-tion✨ Social Media

Have you been feeling disappointed by popular social media platforms lately? Too many ads? Too much social pressure? 
So-tion is the newest, non-comparative social media that allows you to insert life updates, blog posts, and messages to friends! 


## Documentation

In order to be able to run our project, you will need to clone the repo! If you're reading this, you are in the right place my friend! (: 

1. In the terminal, you will have to make sure you have specific requirements to be able to run and see our project's full functionality. You will be able to see what exactly is needed in the requirements.txt file. Whatever you are missing, just go ahead and download it! 

2. Another thing that you will have to do is download the virtual environment! In order to do so, you will need to first install the virtual environment package (name it whatever you want!). The line would look like this in the terminal: pip install virtualenv. 

    a. From there, you will need to create the virtual environment (name it whatever you want, too!). The line for that would look something like: virtualenv mypython. 

    b. Lastly, in order to get the link and run our project in your browser, you will need to activate the virtual environment, which looks something like this: source mypython/bin/activate. (if you are a windows user, it'll look like this: mypthon\Scripts\activate. 

3. Now that you have your virtual environment activated, all you gotta do is enter the line: flask run and then a link should pop up in the terminal (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) and you can copy it and paste it into your browser! And, now (hopefully) it should work!
